# VideoGrabTranscriptCopier
Automate screenshot, transcribe, and OCR to text for any web video! Send notes to Google Doc, save locally, or share with friends and family easily. Note taking and learning has never been so fun.

### Problem Statement 1:
Online learning can feel isolating. Develop a tool or platform that facilitates collaboration, communication, and peer interaction among students in online learning environments.

**Solution:**
This extension addresses this problem by enabling students to seamlessly take screenshots, transcribe videos, and extract text from any web video, including YouTube, Facebook, Twitter (X), Reddit, Dailymotion, Coursera, Canvas, and tutorial sites. By allowing students to easily share notes, transcripts, and OCR-processed text with peers, it enhances collaboration and communication in online learning. Most importantly it makes the process of collaborative note-taking across peers way easier, less cumbersome, and fun, through its integration with Google Docs, a popular platform amongst students! Apart from OCR and transcript features, I will also add translation and other important additions to further make note=taking a 360* immersive experience in this all-in-one tool. 

The ability to store notes in Google Docs, save locally, or share with others makes this tool a powerful platform for students to interact and learn together, bridging the gap in online education by fostering a sense of community and collective learning.

### Problem Statement 4:
Not all learning materials are accessible to students with disabilities. Develop an inclusive learning solution incorporating text-to-speech, closed captions, and alternative learning formats.

**Solution:**
This extension promotes inclusivity by making online learning materials more accessible. It enables users to transcribe video content and extract text using OCR, which can be downloaded as closed captions or converted to text-to-speech for students with visual or hearing impairments. By automating the capture of video segments, transcribing them, and making the content available in multiple formats, this tool ensures that all students, regardless of disabilities, can access and engage with educational materials. This inclusive approach helps create a more equitable learning environment where everyone can participate and benefit fully.
